Automatically label BAS
The goal of this repository is to create a framework that can automatically label BAS points into known classes.  

The implementation steps are : 
1) Collect data from remote servers
2) Build pipelines for data
3) Save data in .csv files (Actually, a noSQL system would suit this application well b/c we are dealing with sequential data
4) Automatically cluster data (unsupervised clustering)
